1- Will be much like 2013 version. It was usable. 
2- Client can create ui elements on map
3- Web worker is the key - mapbox is doing it nearly right way
4- Façade implementation to client for ease of use
5- GeoJSON as main format
6- WGS84 as default (think twice)
7- Client can create his own tools on map that interacts with map
8- Client can create his own containers on map that interacts with map
9- Jasmine for tests, cause creating-a-node-express-webpack-app-with-dev-and-prod-builds says so.
10- Google style guide for js
11- Lint
12- JsDoc 2.0 or such
13- ES6 doesn't give too much benefit. Same s, but different color. Still consider. 
14- Draw.io for mockups and class diagrams and sequence diagrams and such s.
15- Performance has the 1st value.
16- OpenLayers will be used. 
17- Mobile friendly? Might be important. Right now web@mobile with hybrid apps are still suck b. In the future, I don't know...
18- WMS, WFS integration, can connect defined server as storage. OGC is the key. 
19- Loading spinner.
20- Loading spinner @ full size.
21- Toolbar @defined place.
22- Buttons @defined toolbar.
23- Overview map? Noone uses it anyways. Is it that much useful or people wants it just it is standard? Doesn't even look good.
24- Layers, both wfs,wms.
25- There will be no tree, layer of layer, layer of layer of layer... and such. -This one can change.
26- Will never use "its own standards". It does create pita in the future.
