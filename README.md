# arz.js The Map Framework for Humanity
0- Meaning of ARZ is "Earth (in english)" or "Gaia (in greek)".
  
The name comes from Asimov's Foundation series, 4th book, "Foundation's Edge". I wanted to name it "Gaia" but unfortunately there are 23984723947 GAIA frameworks or such things in the world. Plus, github doesn't allow greek letters (trying here: γη). I am happy with the name anyways. It feels like the framework is coming from 'a' and going to 'z' by passing 'r' hehe. It is in turkish, also means "demand". 

1- Map framework that uses OpenLayers 3+ (now they are using semantic versioning and @5... something version, but these are mostly variations of version 3).  
2- Roadmap etc are @ my mind right now, cannot find time to work on it due to work lief :S  
3- Will use google's js style guide  
4- Tests will be on jasmine (could be mocha as well but dunno how to integrate it to project). See 5 for dev-prod env.  
5- Dev env will use node&express just to be able to integrate build&lint&minify&uglify&unit test automation&jsdoc&.. ... ... and such things. Will use this link:

6- Until the end of time or end of the universe; it will be always free of charge.  
7- Working @ Map frameworks and such things since 2012. For each company I worked for, I had to create new mapping framework from scratch cause of using the previous wouldn't be ethical.   
8- I am working with OpenLayers since 2.+ version. Pretty confident on it.  
9- I liek to create new s all the time. I hope I will never lose my ambition on subject. Right now I don't like to stuck@some point and wait for life to bring new opportunities. I am writing this here not to forget it one day.
