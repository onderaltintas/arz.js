   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. You just DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO.
  1. You cannot use codes for anything illegal like printing out the codes and using these papers for rolling something.
  2. The person who starts to write codes and creates this license (which is me) have rights to change conditions totally or partly.
  For example he can remove all the conditions and put "1. The user of this thing should pay 10000 million dollar". 
  I am not planning to do it but maybe... just maybe...
